# Scala Dev

This repository contains the solutions to a set of increasingly difficult problems to familiarise with functional programming (FP) using [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). Problems were taken from a Coursera course given by [Martin Odersky], the designer of the Scala programming language itself.

Projects:

0. Getting started with Scala
    * Working with Lists
    * Using [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) library for testing
1. Experimenting with recursion and functional programming
    * Pascal Triangle
    * Parentheses balance
    * Counting change problem
2. Applying mathematical definitions through FL constructs
    * Functional Sets
3. Usign OOP with FL
    * Object Oriented Sets
4. Compressiong algorithms
    * Huffman encoding/decoding
    * Data structures
    * Complexity
5. Scala's for comprehensions
    * Text processing
    * Anagrams
6. Implement a solver for the [Bloxorz](http://www.miniclip.com/games/bloxorz/en/) game

The repository also contains some experiments on [ScalaZ](http://scalaz.github.io/scalaz), a totally functional extension library for Scala (based on Haskell ideas)
